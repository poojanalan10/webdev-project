                Developed automation test scripts in an existing matured test framework to automate the process of testing

                This job also involved analyzing feature files and user stories for functional testing.
                In a sprint I have Attended scrum meetings to understand the current priorities and the scope for sprints in an agile model.
                Since my work involved automating the testing process I coordinated with Quality assurance manual testers and the software developers 
                to verify conformance with customer established quality check benchmarks. At the end of which I logged defects when bugs were detected.

                errors in an existing piece of code, etc
