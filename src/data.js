        description: "I used the Wisconsin benchmark design to generate data tables of various sizes and perform various experiments on them. I also tested the performance of a system by choosing a variety of queries fetching data of different sizes and attributes under varying conditions. In addition, I recorded the results of execution and measured the performance in terms of time and cost and the impact it had on modifying the query parameters.",

        description: "High-quality data is crucial for any data project. I gained some experience and knowledge of analyzing data sets for quality as a part of this activity. The data set listed all Oregon automobile crashes on Mt. Hood Hwy during 2019 provided by the Oregon Department of Transportation and is part of a larger data set that is often utilized for studies of roads, traffic, and safety. As a part of this activity, I analyzed the crash data and wrote assertions and python code to read in the test data and parse it into python data structures. I used pandasâ€™ methods for reading CSV files into a pandas Dataframe and validated each assertion.Finally, the assertions were represented by plotting various graphs.",
